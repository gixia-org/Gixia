# Gixia
Gixia is an open-sourced research community that promotes research openness.

Here are what will come next in our first release:
+ A platform where people can mark the paper as "Added" or "Read".
+ Once read a paper, user is asked to comment and score it from 1 to 5.
+ A review section is present for further discussion and posting.

Please stay tuned.

## About

Gixia is a product of the non-profit organization **Open Research Organization**, which is founded to promote research openness and communication among scholars all over the world. We are trying to help make paper review more transparent in the first step. It's a big revolution to the long-lasting peer-review history, but we believe we are moving to the next era.
